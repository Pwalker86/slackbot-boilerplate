# Slack Bot Boilerplate
Contains two sample files: realtime_sample.rb and web_sample.rb.

realtime_sample.rb shows how to initialize a realtime client and listen for messages.
web_sample.rb shows how to initialize a regular client and access the api.

# Usage
Clone the repository and run bundle install. Be sure to create a .env file. The .env.sample has information on what tokens are needed.

# Note
It's a good idea to set up your user.email and user.name in your Git Config.
But seriously. It is.
